# IPL Discord Bot
 The server code for an IPL Discord Bot. Can respond to commands for the table, live commentary, scheduled matches of a team, etc

 ## Inviting the Bot to your Discord Guild

 As of right now, you can't! But within a few days I hope to finish the bot and make it inviteable. 
 
## Using the Bot Script on your own
If you want to run the bot on your own server, you need to get a Discord Auth token from Discord Developers, then save it in a .env file in the same directory as your `bot.py` file, like so
`DISCORD_TOKEN={INSERT DISCORD TOKEN HERE}`
